== Name

mdcat - render CommonMark Markdown to text terminals

== Synopsis

*mdcat* [_OPTIONS_] [FILE]...

*mdless* [_OPTIONS_] [FILE]...

== Description

mdcat renders Markdown ``FILE``s in CommonMark dialect to text terminals with sophisticated formatting.
If no `FILE` is given, or if `FILE` is '-', it reads from standard input.

=== CommonMark and terminal support

mdcat supports all basic CommonMark syntax plus a few extensions, highlights syntax in code blocks, and shows inline links and even inline images in some terminal emulators.
In iTerm2 it also adds jump marks for section headings.

=== Pagination

mdcat can render output in a pager; this is the default when run as `mdless`.
The environment variables `$MDCAT_PAGER` and `$PAGER` control the pager used.

=== Image support

In iTerm2, Kitty, Terminology and WezTerm mdcat prints inline images.
mdcat supports most standard pixel formats by default.

mdcat silently ignores images larger than 100 MiB.

=== SVG support

In Terminology mdcat also renders SVG images, using the built-in support of Terminology.

In iTerm2, Kitty and WezTerm mdcat requires `rsvg-convert` to render SVG images to pixel graphics before displaying them;
if `rsvg-convert` is not found in `$PATH` mdcat does not render SVG images in these terminals.

=== HTTP/HTTPS support

mdcat fetches images from HTTP(S) URLs for rendering if the underlying terminal supports image rendering;
pass `--local` to disable this and force mdcat to only use images from the local filesystem.
In this case remote images render as hyperlinks.

== Options

-p::
--paginate::
    Paginate the output of mdcat with a pager like less.
+
**Note:** When paginating mdcat only uses basic ANSI formatting (no images, no hyperlinks) because pager programs normally do not support any sophisticated ANSI formatting features.
+
This is the default when run as `mdless`.

-P::
--no-pager::
    Do not paginate output.
+
This is the default when run as `mdcat`.

-c::
--no-colour::
    Disable all colours and other styles.

--columns::
    Maximum number of columns to use for text output.
    Defaults to the size of the underlying terminal.

-l::
--local::
    Do not access remote resources.

--fail::
    Fail immediately at the first FILE which fails to read.
    By default mdcat continues with the next file.

-h::
--help::
    Show a help message to the user and exit.

-V::
--version::
    Show the version of mdcat and exit.
    The long flag also includes information about the builtin features.


== Exit status

mdcat exits with 0 if no error occurred, or 1 otherwise.

If run as `mdless` or if `--paginate` is given and the pager fails to start mdcat exists with 128.

== Environment

TERM::
    If this variable is `wezterm`, mdcat assumes that the terminal is WezTerm. By default WezTerm does not set TERM to wezterm but mdcat can still detect it trough TERM_PROGRAM.
    If this variable is `xterm-kitty`, mdcat assumes that the terminal is Kitty.
    If this variable starts with `foot`, mdcat assumes that the terminal is foot.

TERM_PROGRAM::
    If this variable is `iTerm.app`, mdcat assumes that the terminal is iTerm2.
    If this variable is `WezTerm`, mdcat assumes that the terminal is WezTerm.

TERMINOLOGY::
    If this variable is `1`, mdcat assumes that the terminal is Terminology.

VTE_VERSION::
    The version of a VTE-based terminal (such as Gnome Terminal).
+
The value of this variable contains four digits (e.g. `6201`) which denote the major and minor version of VTE.
If the value denotes a version greater than `5000` mdcat assumes that the terminal is a modern VTE terminal with support for hyperlinks.
Otherwise mdcat treats the underlying terminal as plain ANSI terminal.

COLUMNS::
    The number of character columns on screen.
+
mdcat only uses this variable if it fails to query the size from the underlying terminal.

ROWS::
    The number of character rows on screen.
+
mdcat only uses this variable if it fails to query the size from the underlying terminal.

MDCAT_PAGER::
    The pager program to use for `mdless` or if `--paginate` is given.
+
The pager program must support basic ANSI formatting sequences, like e.g. `less -R`.
+
The value of this variable is subject to shell-like word-splitting.
It is **not** subject to any kind of expansion or substitution (e.g. parameter expansion, process subsitution, etc.).
+
If set to an empty value, mdcat completely disables pagination.

PAGER::
    The pager program to use if `$MDCAT_PAGER` is unset.
+
Subject to the same rules as `$MDCAT_PAGER`.
+
If both `$PAGER` and `$MDCAT_PAGER` are unset use `less -R` as pager.

http_proxy::
https_proxy::
HTTPS_PROXY::
all_proxy::
ALL_PROXY::
    Proxies for HTTP, HTTPS, or both protocols, to use when fetching images.
+
Each variable provides the proxy for the corresponding protocol as URL, e.g. ``http://proxy.example.com:3128``.
+
The lowercase name takes precedence; note that `$http_proxy` deliberately has no uppercase variant.

no_proxy::
NO_PROXY::
    A comma-separated list of host/domain names or IP address not to use a proxy for.
+
Matches partial hostnames (e.g. `example.org` also disables proxy for `www.example.org`), but always at name boundaries.


== Conforming to

=== CommonMark support and extensions

mdcat supports version 0.29 of the https://spec.commonmark.org/[CommonMark Spec], plus https://github.github.com/gfm/#task-list-items-extension-[Task lists] and https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-[strikethrough], through https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark[pulldown-cmark].

mdcat does **not** yet support footnotes and https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-[tables].
mdcat parses HTML blocks and inline tags but does not apply special rendering; it prints HTML as is.

=== Terminal support

Unless `--no-colour` is given, mdcat translates CommonMark text into ANSI formatted text, with standard SGR formatting codes.
It uses bold (SGR 1), italic (SGR 3) and strikethrough (SGR 9) formatting, and the standard 4-bit color sequences.
It does not use 8-bit or 24-bit color sequences, though this may change in future releases.

Additionally mdcat uses https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda[OSC 8] hyperlinks and other proprietary escape code if it detects specific terminal emulators:

* https://iterm2.com/[iTerm2]: OSC 8 hyperlinks, https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html[iTerm2 inline images], and
https://iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html[Marks].
* https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty[Kitty]: OSC 8 hyperlinks and https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol.html[Kitty Graphics].
* http://terminolo.gy[Terminology]: OSC 8 hyperlinks and Terminology inline images.
* https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal/VTE[VTE 3 based] (0.50 or newer): OSC 8 hyperlinks.
* https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/[WezTerm]: OSC 8 hyperlinks and iTerm2 inline images.
* https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/[foot]: OSC 8 hyperlinks.

== Bugs

Please report bugs to https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues.

Currently mdcat does not yet wrap text to column limits, and does not provide means to customize styles and colours.

== Examples

mdcat hello - world::
    Render markdown in `hello`, then from standard input, then from `world`.

mdless hello:: Render markdown from `mdless` through a pager.
