## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added support for `$TERM=foot*` (see [GH-193])

[GH-193]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/193

## [0.24.1] – 2021-10-30

### Fixed
- Fix semi-broken release.
- Document support for foot in manpage.

## [0.24.0] – 2021-10-30

### Added
- Support for [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/) (see [GH-190]).

[GH-190]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/190

## [0.23.2] – 2021-07-18

### Changed
- WezTerm is now detected by `TERM` and `TERM_PROGRAM` environment variables (see [GH-186]).

[GH-186]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/186

## [0.23.1] – 2021-07-14

### Changed
- Use `TERM_PROGRAM` for determining WezTerm terminal (see [GH-185]).

[GH-185]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/185

## [0.23.0] – 2021-07-04

### Added
- Support for [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) (see [GH-182]).
- Add PowerShell completions (see [GH-183] and [GH-184]).

[GH-182]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/182
[GH-183]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/183
[GH-184]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/184

## [0.22.4] – 2021-04-15

### Changed
- Update dependencies

## [0.22.3] – 2021-02-22
### Added
- Refuse to read more than 100MiB from external resources, e.g. images; mdcat cannot display images of that size reasonably anyway (see [GH-176]).

### Fixed
- Fix type error on FreeBSD (see [GH-177]).

[GH-176]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/176
[GH-177]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/177

## [0.22.2] – 2021-01-01

### Changed
- Replace `reqwest` with `ureq` to fetch images via HTTP/HTTPS (see [GH-168] and [GH-169]);
    the latter has considerably less dependencies and builds faster.
    It also builds statically out of the box, hence the static musl builds no longer require `curl` to fetch images.

### Removed
- The `reqwest` cargo feature (see [GH-168] and [GH-169]).

[GH-168]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/168
[GH-169]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/169

## [0.22.1] – 2020-10-17

### Fixed

- Include manpage source in Windows packages.
    Currently the manpage doesn't build on Windows CI.

## [0.22.0] – 2020-10-17

### Added
- Enable OSC8 hyperlinks in Kitty (see [GH-165]).
    Kitty supports hyperlinks since [version 0.19][kitty-0.19], see [Kitty GH-68].
    Note that `mdcat` *unconditionally* prints hyperlinks if it detects a kitty terminal.
    It makes no attempt to detect whether the Kitty version is compatible or the [`allow_hyperlinks`] setting is enabled.
- `mdcat --version` (but not `mdcat -V`) now informs whether HTTP/HTTPS support is builtin or requires `curl`.
- mdcat now includes a manpage (see [GH-167]).

### Changed
- `mdcat` now asks the controlling terminal for the terminal size and thus correctly detects the terminal size even if standard input, standard output and standard error are all redirected (see [GH-166]).
- `mdcat` no longer requires `kitty icat` to detect the size of kitty windows (see [GH-166]).
    Consequently mdcat can now show images on Kitty terminals even over SSH.
- `mdcat --help` no longer uses colours, and always wraps at 80 characters now.

[GH-166]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/166
[GH-167]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/167

## [0.21.1] – 2020-09-01

### Fixed
- Update pulldown cmark to correctly ignore footnote refs (see [GH-155]).

[GH-155]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/155

## [0.21.0] – 2020-08-12

### Added
- Add `--paginate` flag to paginate the output of mdcat (see [GH-152]);
  with this flag mdcat sends it output to `less -R` or any alternative pager set in `$MDCAT_PAGER` or `$PAGER`.
  This flag also disables all terminal-specific formatting as the pager likely won't support it.
- Paginate output by default if invoked as `mdless`, that is, if `mdcat` is hard-linked to `mdless`.

### Fixed
- Render email autolinks (i.e. `<hello@example.com>`) as `mailto:` links.

[GH-152]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/152

## [0.20.0] – 2020-07-05
### Added
- `mdcat::TerminalCapabilities` now exposes constructors for specific terminal emulators.
- Render reference link definitions as inline links if possible (see [GH-149]).
    This mainly affects image links inside inline links which get rendered as reference links.
- `mdcat::Environment` now contains all environment information required to render properly, namely the local hostname and the base URL.

### Changed
- `mdcat::push_tty` now takes an `mdcat::Environment` instead of `base_dir`.
    `base_dir` is now part of `mdcat::Environment`.
- Image links now use purple foreground text (see [GH-140] and [GH-149]).
- Image links render as inline links if the terminal does not support inline images and the image is not inside another link (see [GH-141]).
- `mdcat::TerminalCapabilities` now uses `Option` to denote missing capabilities.

### Fixed
- Always treat links targets as URLs, never as paths.
- On ITerm2 only use the last segment of image URLs as filename for inline images (see [GH-149]).
    Previously mdcat used the full URL based on a misunderstanding of the [Inline Images Protocol].

[GH-140]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/140

[GH-149]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/149
[Inline Images Protocol]: https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html

## [0.19.0] – 2020-06-19
### Added
- Release packages now include generated shell completions for Bash, Zsh and Fish.

### Changed
- Blockquotes no longer have green foreground text (see [GH-144]).

[GH-144]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/144

## [0.18.4] – 2020-06-14
### Fixed
- Fix typo in release workflow.
- Update all dependencies to no longer depend on yanked crate versions.

## [0.18.3] – 2020-06-14
### Fixed
- Properly ignore alt text of inline images (see [GH-148]).

[GH-148]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/148

## [0.18.2] – 2020-05-31
### Fixed
- Properly upload binaries for releases.

## [0.18.1] – 2020-05-31
### Fixed
- Fix typo in release workflow.

## [0.18.0] – 2020-05-31
### Added
- Add `mdcat::Error` as type alias to `std::io::Error`.

### Changed
- New simpler rendering algorithm (see GH-[142]) which solves numerous rendering
  issues (see below).
- Handle internal errors with [anyhow] to add more context to errors (see
  [GH-139]}.
- `mdcat::push_tty` only fails with `std::io::Error`: `mdcat` never visibly
  fails unless it can’t write output.

### Fixed
- Respect `--local-only` and resource access policy; this got lost in some
  refactoring (see [GH-146]).
- Consistent margins and newlines around paragraphs, HTML blocks and inside list
  items (see [GH-142]).
- Correctly indent nested code blocks in lists and block quotes (see [GH-142]).
- No longer print leading blank lines before lists (see [GH-142]).
- Correctly indent block quotes (see [GH-142]).
- Colorize the entire text of links (see [GH-142]).

[anyhow]: https://docs.rs/crate/anyhow
[GH-146]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/146

## [0.17.1] – 2020-05-24
### Fixed
- Correctly scale down large images on [kitty] (see [GH-124] and [GH-133] by
  [@fspillner]).

[GH-124]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/124
[GH-133]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/133

## [0.17.0] – 2020-05-20
### Changed
- `mdcat` is now distributed under the [MPL 2](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) license;
  some source files remain Apache 2.0 due to 3rd party rights (see [GH-138]).

### Fixed
- Do not fail with broken pipe error when rending large images (see [GH-134] by
  [@fspillner]).

[GH-134]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/134
[GH-138]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/138

## [0.16.1] – 2020-05-15
### Changed
- `mdcat::push_tty` now takes a `mdcat::Settings` struct which groups all
  external settings.

### Fixed
- Ignore broken pipes; `mdcat | head` no longer errors when `head` closes stdout
  of mdcat early (see [GH-136]).

[GH-136]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/136

## [0.16.0] – 2020-04-11
### Changed
- Upgrade to syntect 4.1 and enable its pure Rust regex backend to simplify
  building (see [GH-131]).  This crate now builds without Clang which fixes
  Clang-related build issues (see [GH-90])

[GH-90]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/90
[GH-131]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/131

## [0.15.1] – 2020-02-15
### Changed
- Update pulldown-cmark to 0.7.

## [0.15.0] – 2020-01-11
### Added
- Release builds now perform full link-time optimization to create a smaller
  binary.  We do recommend to also `strip` the `mdcat` binary.
- Render SVG images in [kitty] (see [GH-114]).
- Update to reqwest 0.10.
- Process file list as input (see [GH-54] and [GH-115], by [@norman-abramovitz]):
    - Add `--fail` flag to exit on the first error when processing a file list;
      the default behaviour is to continue with the next file in case of error.

### Changed
- Replace `remote_resources` feature with `reqwest` feature to use reqwest for
  retrieving remote resources, and fall back to the `curl` command if `reqwest`
  is disabled.

## [0.14.0] – 2019-12-18
### Added
- Render images in [kitty] (see [GH-65] and [GH-104] by [@fspillner]).

### Changed
- Update pulldown-cmark to 0.6 which supports CommonMark 0.29 and improves
  parser speed and correctness.
- Enable SIMD in pulldown-cmark to squeeze out the last bit of performance.
- Remove all features except `remote_resources` to reduce build complexity.

### Removed
- No longer depend on `immeta`.

## [0.13.0] – 2019-03-30
### Added
- Render task lists nicely (see [GH-72]).
- Render strike-through text (see [GH-71]).  Some terminals do not support this
  feature, and mdcat does not have a fallback currently (see [GH-73]).

## [0.12.1] – 2018-12-24
### Fixed
- Do not add newline after inline text with styles disabled (see [GH-49]).

[GH-49]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/49

## [0.12.0] – 2018-12-20
### Added
- Add `TerminalCapability` struct as replacement for `mdcat::Terminal` trait to
  remove dynamic dispatch and allow for more accurate and less complicated
  conditional compilation of terminal support for different platforms (see
  [GH-45]).
- Move to Rust 2018, and raise minimum supported Rust version to 1.31 (see
  [GH-46]).

### Changed
- Drop support for Rust 1.29 and older.
- Do not test specific Rust on versions on Travis CI any longer; Rust stable
  becomes the lowest supported Rust version.

### Removed
- `mdcat::Terminal` trait and implementations (see [GH-45]).

### Fixed
- Set hostname to local hostname for inline links to `file://` URLs, which
  should properly resolve `file://` URLs over SSH (see [OSC 8 file URLs],
  [GH-42] and [GH-44]).

## [0.11.0] – 2018-10-25
### Changed
- Always print colours regardless of whether stdout if a tty or not.
- Replace `--colour` option with a `--no-colour` flag to turn off styled output.
- `mdcat::push_tty` no longer takes ownership of the `terminal` argument (see
  [GH-41]).
- Travis CI builds Windows binaries now.
- Test formatting output.

[GH-41]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/41

## [0.10.1] – 2018-09-09
### Fixed
- Properly package musl binary on Travis CI; restores Linux binary in releases.

## [0.10.0] – 2018-09-09
### Added
- Support colours on Windows 10 console (see [GH-36]).
- Support musl target on Linux (see [GH-37] and [GH-38]).
- Published Linux binary statically links musl now, and has no runtime
  dependencies (see [GH-29] and [GH-38]).

## [0.9.2] – 2018-08-26
### Fixed
- Do not falsely ignore deployments from Travis CI for Linux and macOS.

## [0.9.1] – 2018-08-26
### Added
- Publish binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows (see [GH-28]).

### Fixed
- Correctly build macOS and Linux binaries on Travis CI.

[GH-28]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/28

## [0.9.0] – 2018-08-26
### Added
- `mdcat` builds on Windows now (see [GH-33] and [GH-34]).

### Changed

  new `Terminal` trait and dynamic dispatch (see [GH-35]).
- Allow to disable specific terminal backends (see [GH-35]).
- Update minimum Rust version to 1.27.

[GH-34]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/34
[GH-35]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/35

## [0.8.0] – 2018-02-15
### Added
- Render SVG images in iTerm2 with `rsvg-convert` (requires `librsvg`).
- Expose `TerminalWrite` in `mdcat` crate (see [GH-20] by [@Byron]).

[GH-20]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/20
[@Byron]: https://github.com/Byron

## [0.7.0] – 2018-02-08
### Added
- Show images from HTTP and HTTPS URLs inline in iTerm2.
- Add `--local` flag to render only local images inline; for remote images, eg,
  HTTP URLs, show only the image title and the URL.
- Expose `mdcat` as a library crate (see [GH-18]), but with no guarantees
  about a stable interface, as `mdcat` stays at version 0.x for now.
- Show `--help` with colours.

### Changed
- Adhere to Semantic Versioning, but stay pre-1.0 so anything still goes.

[GH-18]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/18

## [0.6.0] – 2018-02-02
### Added
- Show inline images in [Terminology] (see [GH-16] by [@vinipsmaker]).

[Terminology]: http://terminolo.gy
[GH-16]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/16
[@vinipsmaker]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/vinipsmaker

### Changed
- Improve `--help` output: Hide some redundant options, add a bug reporting URL
  and explain the purpose of `mdcat`.
- Reduce dependencies and thus build time

## [0.5.0] – 2018-01-27
### Added
- Show links inline in iTerm2 and terminals based on VTE 0.50 or newer (see
  [GH-8], [GH-14] and [GH-15]).

[GH-8]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/8
[GH-14]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/14
[GH-15]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/15

### Changed
- Improve `--help` output.

### Fixed
- Remove redundant default value from `--colour` help text (see [GH-10], by [@wezm]).
- Replace light black with green; the former doesn't work with Solarized Dark.

[GH-10]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/10
[@wezm]: https://github.com/wezm

## [0.4.0] – 2018-01-21
### Changed
- Use 8-bit ANSI colours for syntax highlighting to fit all kinds of terminal
  colour themes.

### Fixed
- Remove excess space at the end of code blocks

### Removed
- Remove `--light` switch which became redundant due to better syntax
  highlighting.

## [0.3.0] – 2018-01-19
### Added

- Show images inline on iTerm.

### Changed
- Rename to `mdcat`; I have no plans to add paging to this tool.
